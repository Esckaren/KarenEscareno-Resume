        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Karen Escareno and I am currently a third year at the University of California, Riverside. I have experience with productions and theatre since elementary school. I love being able to work as a team to create a production that flows and entertains all audiences. Currently I am working on a few projects where I am a script reader and actor. I have learned to utilize and manage my time efficiently do I can balance my projects seamlessly. I recently volunteered at a weekend fundraiser where we improvised everything in many settings and scenes. I learned to think quickly in a way that involved socializing and reading not only my partners body language, but also the audience‚Äôs body language in order to provide entertainment that could be driven by the audience to connect them to a lively experience. <br><br>

        I have experience working as a team starting in high school. At 16 years old I became a merchandiser at GAP factory. My job skills there consisted of communicating and understanding coworkers in order to change the presentation of our store daily. In just a few months I earned the title ‚ÄúEmployee of the Month‚Äù. After a year I gained the title of merchandising manager because I was able to understand the requirements and details asked by corporate. I was able to help others understand thoroughly and fix obstacles that prompted suddenly. <br><br>

        Over the span of 7 months, I have learned had the positions of a cashier assistant, cashier, membership assistant, self-checkout cashier, and a holiday leader. I learned from the day to the next how to ring and quickly acquired the different rules. Since Gap Factory I have been accustomed to scan and search SKUs in order to made the transaction quick while integrating customer service. Not only have I been able to improve my communication skills, but as well as my ability to accept feedback and use it to better my performance. For example, at Costco I recently had to explain to customers the difference between a gold star membership and an executive membership after a customer complained about having to pay excessively for a membership, she knew nothing about to supervisor because I could not answer her question. My supervisor informed me that my customer was upset with me so I learned the benefits of explained how the executive membership helps them earn money back and save on purchases whereas the gold star membership only get them in through the door! I have learned to assist, ring, search information, print memberships (to customers in English and Spanish), and I would love to help refund items so our team can increase our loyalty and profits. Being able to use feedback and turn it into a better version of your self is something not everyone can do, but I have mastered since working at a young age because as a 16-year-old I had much to learn. Now I am able to adapt to new settings and help more customers our Costco is in a Spanish dominated area. I am excited to discuss how I can help our company increase our customer loyalty. I will be accessible at any time at kesca010@ucr.edu when you need my help!
